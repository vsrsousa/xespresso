# Pull Request Summary

## Overview

This PR addresses two issues:

1. **Original Request**: Add system folder navigation using tkinter dialog
2. **Critical Bug Discovered**: Job files sometimes contain unwanted quotes around commands

Both issues have been successfully resolved with comprehensive testing and documentation.

## 🎯 Issue 1: System Folder Browser (Feature Enhancement)

### Problem
The user wanted better access to system folders for selecting the working directory, suggesting use of tkinter to open a native file dialog.

### Solution
Added a "Browse System Folders" button that opens a native OS folder picker dialog:

- **Button Location**: GUI sidebar, above Quick Access
- **Works On**: Windows, macOS, Linux (with python3-tk installed)
- **Fallback**: Gracefully disabled if tkinter unavailable
- **All existing features preserved**: Quick access buttons, subfolder navigation, custom path input

### Installation (Linux only)
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# Fedora/RHEL  
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

# Arch
sudo pacman -S tk
```

### Usage
1. Launch xespresso GUI: `xespresso-gui` or `python -m xespresso.gui`
2. Look for "📂 Browse System Folders" button in sidebar
3. Click to open native folder picker
4. Select folder - it becomes your working directory

## 🐛 Issue 2: Job File Quotes Bug (Critical Fix)

### Problem
Job scripts were sometimes generated with unwanted quotes:

```bash
# WRONG - with quotes
"export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1"
"srun --mpi=pmi2" pw.x -in espresso.pwi

# CORRECT - without quotes
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
srun --mpi=pmi2 pw.x -in espresso.pwi
```

### Root Cause
Machine configuration JSON files contained embedded quotes in string values:
```json
{
  "launcher": "\"srun --mpi=pmi2\"",
  "prepend": ["\"export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1\""]
}
```

### Solution
Automatic sanitization of machine configurations when loaded:

- **Transparent**: No user action required
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing configs work as before
- **Fixes Existing Configs**: Automatically removes embedded quotes
- **Comprehensive**: Sanitizes launcher, prepend, postpend, modules, and other fields

### Impact
- ✅ Job files now generate correctly
- ✅ Existing broken configs are automatically fixed
- ✅ New configs won't have this issue
- ✅ No migration or user intervention needed

## 🚀 How to Test

### Test the Quotes Fix
1. Create a machine config with embedded quotes (or use an existing broken one)
2. Load the config and generate a job file
3. Verify the job file has no quotes around commands

### Test the Folder Browser
1. Launch GUI: `xespresso-gui`
2. Click "📂 Browse System Folders" button
3. Select a folder in the native dialog
4. Verify it becomes the working directory
