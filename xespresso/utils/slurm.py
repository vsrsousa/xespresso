def check_slurm_available():
    """
    Validates that the SLURM job scheduler is installed and operational on the system.

    This function performs two checks:
    1. Verifies that the 'sbatch' command is available in the system's PATH.
    2. Confirms that the SLURM controller daemon ('slurmctld') is responsive via 'scontrol ping'.

    Behavior:
    - If the environment variable XESPRESSO_FORCE_SCHEDULER is set to '1', all checks are skipped.
    - If VERBOSE_ERRORS is True (via XESPRESSO_VERBOSE_ERRORS), full Python tracebacks will be shown.
      Otherwise, errors are raised cleanly without traceback clutter.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If SLURM is not installed or not responding, unless overridden by environment.

    Example:
        >>> check_slurm_available()
        # Raises RuntimeError with a clean message if SLURM is unavailable

    Environment Variables:
        XESPRESSO_FORCE_SCHEDULER: Set to '1' to bypass SLURM checks entirely.
        XESPRESSO_VERBOSE_ERRORS: Set to '1', 'true', or 'yes' to enable full tracebacks on failure.
