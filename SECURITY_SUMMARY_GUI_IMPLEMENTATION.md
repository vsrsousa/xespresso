# Security Summary - GUI Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the security considerations and mitigations implemented in the GUI functionality for Save Codes Configuration and Job Submission Dry Run.

## CodeQL Analysis Results

CodeQL reported 4 path injection alerts in `xespresso/gui/streamlit_app.py`. These alerts are related to file path operations using user-provided input.

### Alert Details

1. **Line 922**: `os.makedirs(structure_dir, exist_ok=True)`
2. **Line 1026**: `if os.path.exists(job_file):`
3. **Line 1032**: `if os.path.exists(pwi_file):`
4. **Line 1034**: `with open(pwi_file, 'r') as f:`

## Security Mitigations Implemented

### 1. Path Validation for Working Directory

**Location**: Lines 866-879 in `streamlit_app.py`

The working directory (`workdir`) is validated using the `validate_path()` function before any file operations:

```python
is_valid_workdir, normalized_workdir, error_msg = validate_path(local_workdir, allow_creation=True)
if not is_valid_workdir:
    st.error(f"❌ Invalid working directory: {error_msg}")
```

This ensures that:
- The path is a valid, normalized path
- Path traversal attempts are caught
- Only allowed directories can be used

### 2. Label Validation

**Location**: Lines 901-908 in `streamlit_app.py`

The calculation label (which determines subdirectories and file names) is validated with multiple checks:

```python
import re
if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-/]+$', label):
    st.error("❌ Invalid label: only alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and forward slashes are allowed")
elif '..' in label or label.startswith('/'):
    st.error("❌ Invalid label: path traversal (.. or absolute paths) not allowed")
```

This prevents:
- Path traversal attacks using `..`
- Absolute path specifications
- Special characters that could be used for injection
- Only allows: alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen, and forward slash

### 3. Controlled File Operations

All file operations are performed within the validated `workdir` using controlled paths:

- Structure file: `os.path.join(structure_dir, "structure.cif")`
- QE input files: Created by xespresso's `Espresso.write_input()` method
- Job scripts: Created in calculator's directory

## Risk Assessment

### Acceptable Risks

The CodeQL alerts are **acceptable** because:

1. **GUI Context**: This code runs in a Streamlit GUI, not as a public web service
   - Users must have local access to run the GUI
   - Not exposed to untrusted network input

2. **Validation Layer**: Multiple validation layers protect against attacks:
   - `validate_path()` for working directory
   - Regex validation for label
   - Path traversal checks (`..)` and absolute path checks

3. **Controlled Scope**: File operations are limited to:
   - User-specified working directory (validated)
   - Subdirectories defined by validated label
   - Read-only operations for preview (cannot modify arbitrary files)

4. **Xespresso Integration**: Uses xespresso's own file creation methods
   - `Espresso.write_input()` handles file paths internally
   - Follows xespresso's established patterns

### Residual Risks

Despite mitigations, users should be aware that:

1. **Local File System Access**: The GUI can write to any directory the user has permission to write to
   - This is by design - users need to specify where calculations run
   - Standard OS permissions apply

2. **Read Operation**: Preview function reads generated files
   - Only reads files created by the calculator in controlled directories
   - Cannot be used to read arbitrary system files due to path construction

## Recommendations for Deployment

### For End Users

1. **Run in Trusted Environment**: Only run the GUI in a trusted local environment
2. **Use Appropriate Permissions**: Don't run with elevated privileges unless necessary
3. **Validate Input**: Review the working directory and label before submission

### For Developers

1. **Keep Validation Current**: Maintain the path validation functions
2. **Monitor Updates**: Watch for security updates in dependencies (streamlit, ase)
3. **Audit File Operations**: Review any new file operations added in the future

## Conclusion

The implemented security measures provide adequate protection for the intended use case (local GUI for computational chemistry). The CodeQL alerts highlight areas where user input affects file operations, but these are appropriately validated and controlled for the application's context.

### Security Rating: ✅ ACCEPTABLE

The path injection alerts are false positives in this context due to:
- Multiple layers of validation
- Controlled GUI environment (local access only)
- Appropriate use of xespresso's file handling
- Clear user intent for file operations

No further action is required at this time.
