# GUI Improvements Implementation Summary

This document details all the improvements made to the xespresso GUI based on the problem statement.

## Overview

The GUI has been comprehensively updated to address all issues mentioned in the problem statement. The improvements focus on usability, persistence, clarity, and functionality.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Machine Configuration (`🖥️ Machine Configuration`)

#### Issues Addressed:
- ✅ Machine selection not persistent across navigation
- ✅ Test connection shows no feedback
- ✅ Unclear what "Save machine configuration" does
- ✅ No way to view current saved configuration
- ✅ Difficult to change only resources without losing settings

#### Implementation:
- **Persistence**: Added `current_machine_name` to session state to maintain selection across page changes
- **Configuration Display**: Added expandable "View Current Configuration" section showing current machine settings
- **Test Connection**: Fully implemented with detailed feedback:
  - For local machines: Shows user and working directory
  - For remote machines: Tests SSH connection, shows connection status, authenticates with SSH key
  - Displays error messages with specific failure reasons (authentication, network, missing key)
- **Clear Documentation**: Added info message explaining that saving creates machine-specific JSON files in `~/.xespresso/machines/` and doesn't modify pre-configured `machines.json`
- **File Location Display**: Shows where configuration is saved after successful save

### 2. Codes Configuration (`⚙️ Codes Configuration`)

#### Issues Addressed:
- ✅ Detected codes not saved to JSON file
- ✅ Multiple QE versions on same machine not supported
- ✅ Module load not version-specific
- ✅ No way to label different versions
- ✅ No way to choose which code/version to use

#### Implementation:
- **Version Labeling**: Added "Version Label" input field for user-defined labels (e.g., 'qe-7.2', 'qe-dev')
- **Version-Specific Modules**: Module configuration now supports version-specific modules (e.g., 'qe/7.2', 'quantum_espresso-7.4.1')
- **Multiple Version Support**: Clear explanation that detected codes are **merged** with existing configurations
- **Save Confirmation**: Added info box explaining merge behavior and preservation of multiple versions
- **Code Selection**: New section "Select Code Version for Calculations" with dropdown to choose which version to use

- **Dual Parameter**:
  - Added configurable dual parameter (default: 4.0)
  - Range: 1.0 to 12.0

  - Enable/disable checkbox
  - Per-element Hubbard U configuration:
    - U value (eV) from 0 to 10
    - Orbital selection (2p, 3d, 4f)
  - Configuration stored in `workflow_config['hubbard_u']`
  
- **Parameter Persistence**:
  - All parameters now use session state defaults
  - ecutwfc, dual, conv_thr, nspin, occupations, smearing, degauss all persistent
  - Spin polarization selection persists across navigation
  
- **Band Structure Options** (calculation-specific):
  - New section when "Bands" calculation type selected
  - K-path selection: Automatic (seekpath) or Custom Path
  - Custom path input (e.g., 'GXMGRX')
  - Number of k-points along path (10-500)
  - Settings stored in workflow config

### 5. Job Submission (`🚀 Job Submission`)
