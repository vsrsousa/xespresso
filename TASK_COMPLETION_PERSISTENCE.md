# Task Completion Summary: Machine/Code/Version Persistence and Adaptive Resources

## Problem Statement

The user reported two issues in the xespresso GUI:

1. **Machine selections do not persist**: When navigating between Calculation Setup and Workflow Builder pages, the selected machine, code, and version were not preserved. Users had to re-select them each time.

2. **Missing adaptive resources in Calculation Setup**: The Workflow Builder had adaptive resources that showed only relevant options based on machine type (direct execution vs scheduler), but Calculation Setup did not have this feature.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Cross-Page Persistence

**Implementation:**
- Replaced page-specific session state variables with shared variables
- Added default index handling to restore previous selections
- Both pages now use:
  - `selected_machine` (shared)
  - `selected_version` (shared)
  - `selected_code` (shared)

**Before:**
```python
# Calculation Setup
st.session_state.selected_machine_for_calc = selected_machine

# Workflow Builder  
st.session_state.selected_machine_for_workflow = selected_machine
```

**After:**
```python
# Both pages
st.session_state.selected_machine = selected_machine
```

**User Impact:**
- Selections now persist when navigating between pages
- No need to re-select machine, code, or version
- Seamless user experience

### 2. Adaptive Resources for Calculation Setup

**Implementation:**
- Added scheduler type detection
- Show different UI based on machine configuration:
  - **Direct execution**: Only nprocs and launcher
  - **Scheduler (SLURM/PBS/SGE)**: Full resource configuration

**Direct Execution Mode:**
```python
if scheduler_type == "direct":
    nprocs = st.number_input("Number of Processors (nprocs):", ...)
    # Show resolved launcher command
    st.caption(f"Launcher will be: `{resolved_launcher}`")
```

**Scheduler Mode:**
```python
else:
    nodes = st.number_input("Nodes:", ...)
    ntasks_per_node = st.number_input("Tasks per Node:", ...)
    memory = st.text_input("Memory:", ...)
    time = st.text_input("Time Limit:", ...)
    partition = st.text_input("Partition/Queue:", ...)
```

**User Impact:**
- Clearer UI that shows only relevant options
- Less confusion for direct execution users
- Better understanding of what resources are being configured

## Files Modified

1. **xespresso/gui/pages/calculation_setup.py**
   - Updated machine/code/version selectors to use shared state
   - Added default index handling for machine selector
   - Implemented adaptive resources configuration
   - Added scheduler type detection
   - Added launcher placeholder resolution

2. **xespresso/gui/pages/workflow_builder.py**
   - Updated machine/code/version selectors to use shared state
   - Added default index handling for machine selector
   - No changes to resources (already had adaptive resources)

## Testing

### Automated Tests (All Passed)

Created `/tmp/test_persistence.py` to verify:

1. **Shared State Variables Test** ✓
   - Verified both pages use `selected_machine`
   - Verified both pages use `selected_version`
   - Verified both pages use `selected_code`
   - Confirmed old page-specific variables are not used

2. **Default Index Handling Test** ✓
   - Verified machine selectors compute default index
   - Verified selectors have index parameter
   - Confirmed previous selections are restored

3. **Adaptive Resources Test** ✓
   - Verified scheduler type detection
   - Verified direct execution mode shows only nprocs
   - Verified scheduler mode shows full resources
   - Verified launcher placeholder resolution

4. **Consistency Test** ✓
   - Verified both pages have adjust_resources checkbox
   - Verified both pages handle scheduler_type
   - Verified both pages show appropriate options

**Test Results:**

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

1. **MACHINE_CODE_PERSISTENCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md**
   - Detailed technical documentation
   - Implementation details
   - Code examples
   - Session state flow diagrams
   - Backward compatibility notes

2. **VISUAL_GUIDE_PERSISTENCE.md**
   - Visual before/after comparisons
   - User workflow examples
   - UI mockups showing changes
   - Technical implementation snippets
   - Summary table of improvements

## Benefits

### For Users

1. **Seamless Navigation**: Selections persist across pages
2. **Better UX**: No need to re-select machine/code/version
3. **Clarity**: Only relevant options shown based on machine type
4. **Less Confusion**: Direct execution users don't see scheduler options
5. **Consistency**: Both pages behave identically

### For Developers

1. **Code Reuse**: Same pattern used in both pages
2. **Maintainability**: Shared state easier to maintain
3. **Consistency**: Less code duplication
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add more shared selections

## Backward Compatibility

✓ **100% Backward Compatible**
- Existing machine configurations work without modification
- Session state additions don't break existing functionality
- UI enhancements are additive, not replacing
- No breaking changes to API or file formats

## Verification Steps

To verify the implementation works:

1. **Test Persistence:**
   ```
   1. Open GUI
   2. Go to Calculation Setup
   3. Select Machine 3
   4. Navigate to Workflow Builder
   5. Verify Machine 3 is selected ✓
   6. Change to Machine 5
   7. Navigate back to Calculation Setup
   8. Verify Machine 5 is selected ✓
   ```

2. **Test Adaptive Resources (Direct):**
   ```
   1. Select machine with scheduler="direct"
   2. Enable "Adjust Resources"
   3. Verify only "Number of Processors" is shown ✓
   4. Verify launcher command is displayed ✓
   ```

3. **Test Adaptive Resources (Scheduler):**
   ```
   1. Select machine with scheduler="slurm"
   2. Enable "Adjust Resources"
   3. Verify full resources are shown ✓
   4. Verify "Scheduler Mode" label is shown ✓
   ```
