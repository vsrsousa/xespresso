Tests for graphene monolayer using ase.build.graphene

This module tests graphene monolayer structures for DFT calculations
with Quantum ESPRESSO through xespresso. Requires ASE >= 3.22.1.

Tests:
    test_graphene_structure: Validates structure creation (no QE required)
    test_graphene_scf: Tests SCF calculation with graphene (requires QE)
    test_graphene_relax: Tests structural relaxation (requires QE)

The graphene_monolayer fixture in conftest.py provides a pre-configured
graphene structure with 15 Angstrom vacuum in z-direction.

Example:
    Run structure test (no QE required):
        pytest tests/test_graphene.py::test_graphene_structure -v
    
    Run all graphene tests:
        pytest tests/test_graphene.py -v
